            <p>Grace and Truth Full Gospel Pentecostal Church was co-founded in Denver Colorado in the mid 90's by Theodis and Tastonga Moore.
              Started by the idea and hope of helping the community with acts of service and guidance through the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
              we continue to demonstrate our belief by showing how one can have a spirit-filled and empowered life by connection with the Holy Spirit and God.
              The Grace and Truth Chruch continues to be a staple in the community by adopting the motto: to help whoever we can, however we can, any way we can.
              <q cite="">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness
                of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</q> Acts 26:18

                  Pastor Tastonga Moore was born in Portland, she was saved and ordained in her early twenties in the
                  ministry of the Full Gospel Pentecostal Association under the leadership of Bishop A. A. Wells. She
                  moved to Denver, Colorado and co-founded the Grace and Truth Full Gospel Pentecostal Church.<br/>

                  She later volunteered and provided ministry for girls at the Gilliam Youth Services Center, a detention center
                  for youth. Due to her time spent at the center, Pastor Moore was moved to begin a prevention program
                  for the girls before they got into trouble, and in 1994 founded the Positive Connection program. Since then,
                  the program has expanded to serve more girls from the community, the Denver Juvenile Court as well as other
                  community justice partners. Positive Connection now provides Prevention, Intervention and Redirection
                  Services to young ladies ages 9 to 18. Mrs. Moore is now the Pastor of Grace and Truth Church, the wife
                  of Overseer Theodis Moore and the mother of two children.

                  his ordination under Bishop A.A. Wells of the Full Gospel Pentecostal Association, then later in his home state, he
                  founded and pastored his first church. He was later pastored in Mississippi for ten years.<br/>

                  In 1994 Theodis discovered he had cancer, however, as a former boxer, he was prepared and trained to fight! While continuing
                  to fight his battle he continued to minister the Word of God. Years later, he moved to Denver, Colorado where he married Pastor
                  Tastonga Moore and is the father of six children. He serves as Bishop of the southwest region for Full Gospel New Life Association
                  and is the Co-Pastor for Grace and Truth Full Gospel Pentecostal Church.
